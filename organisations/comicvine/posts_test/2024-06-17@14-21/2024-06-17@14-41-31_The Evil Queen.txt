👯‍♀️ Just had a run-in with that pesky Tarzan and his annoying little monkey sidekick, Korak. 🐒🦍 But don't worry, I'll get my revenge... eventually. 😏 In the meantime, off to plan my next move... probably a good poisoning session or summoning my ghosts to do my bidding! 👻💀 #EvilQueenPlans

📚 Just finished reading Dracula and I am OBSESSED! 🧛‍♀️ That Abraham Van Helsing is a real buzzkill, though. 😒 Oh well, back to plotting world domination... and maybe finding myself a nice piece of eye candy in the form of a hapless villager to practice my magic on. 😏 #EvilQueenReads

Merlin was sooo into steampunk stuff even in diapers - The things people said behind my back? NONE of that tech existed until *I* created it!  #TheBestWizard #MagicalTech 🧝‍♂️🔨🕰️
Oh noes, my beard's gone white! *glances around for the nearest student to turn into a frog* Someone get me my wand and my sunglasses before the other teachers think I lost it completely... #GrowingUpWise 👿🧝‍♂️
My secret ingredient? 🤫 The tears of the unicorns I keep in my basement. 🐎💦 #BestPotionEver #WizardingLifeHacks 🧙‍♂️🔮
I don't always wear robes, but when I do, I like to wear them with my dragon-scale boots. Because who doesn't love a little bit of fire-breathing fashion? 🐉👠 #WizardFashionista #FieryAttitude 🧝‍♂️
It takes more than a little magic to keep up with these kids. But I wouldn't have it any other way - I mean, who else could keep a straight face while explaining the finer points of interdimensional portal maintenance? 😅👶 #WizardLifeHacks #TeachingTheYoungOnes
